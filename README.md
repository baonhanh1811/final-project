3. Data Types:
- In Orders.csv, the "Order Date" column is currently in object (string) format and should be converted 
to a proper date format for any time-based analysis.

- Outliers in Numeric Data (from Details.csv): Amount: The minimum value of 4 and maximum value of 5729 appear normal, though there is a wide range.

- Profit: There are negative values in the "Profit" column, which may indicate losses. However, some values seem extreme (e.g., -1981), so these should be checked to determine if they are valid or errors.

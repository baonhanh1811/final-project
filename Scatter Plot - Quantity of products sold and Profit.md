Discription: 
- This chart shows the ratio between the number of products sold by the business and the profit of each product.

Reviews: 
- The blue points indicate data points of very high profits, figures of up to 1500 units. Conversely, there are some negative profit data points that may describe the business that has made a loss. This problem can occur when the production and selling costs are too high compared to the revenue, or it can also occur when the discount is too low and the sales are high.

Purpose: 
- It can be seen that the number of sales is not the most important factor to increase profits, because businesses need to simultaneously increase the number of sales and at the same time pay attention to many other aspects such as cost, quality of products, target customer files, etc.
- Understanding the relationship between the number of products and profits helps businesses evaluate the effectiveness of the products they sell
- Identify the best-selling products to focus on developing them
- Grasp the products with poor sales to have timely solutions such as improving the product or replacing
- Evaluate the effectiveness of communication campaigns by comparing profits before and after implementing the campaign.

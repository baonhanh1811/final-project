Linear Regression: 
-  Linear regression algorithm gives the result of a model used to predict the relationship between two values ​​Amount and Profit. This chart helps predict the trend from real data including two parts: data points and linear regression line.

- The blue data points show the real relationship between two values ​​Amount and Profit. It can be seen that the dispersion between these points is very large, they do not lie along the red regression line, from which the variation of these two values ​​can be seen.

- The red regression line shows the most generalized relationship between the two values, it has a positive slope, showing that the relationship between these two values ​​both increases, that is, when the Amount value increases, the Profit value also increases slightly.
- It is very clear that the R-squared value is low, showing that this model is almost unsuitable to describe the relationship between Amount and Profit.

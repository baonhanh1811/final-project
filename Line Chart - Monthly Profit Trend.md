- Profits dropped to their lowest level around May 2018. Maybe the business has encountered some kind of business problem.
- From January to March, the first quarter of the year, the demand for goods increases because as mentioned above, this data is taken from people and customers in India, from January to March in India there are very big festivals such as the Uttarayan International Kite Festival in Ahmedabad, the Ugadi Festival in Hyderabad in February, so the demand for goods increases, reaching nearly 10,000. In the low months such as March to May, June to July and August to September, there are not many special occasions or any events, so the demand of buyers also decreases. However, in July and August, the chart may increase a little because in these two months and summer, the demand for goods increases due to holidays or travel, and there are also some big events that stand out in these months such as the Indian Monsoon Festival in July-August.

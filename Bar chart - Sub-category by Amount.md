Reviews: 
- The chart has 15 main categories and the most important dead end sales are printers with sales of nearly 60,000 showing a large difference between the highest category which is printers and shirts with only about 2000 that is what we see most clearly in the chart seeing the difference between the highest and lowest product sales performance and which products are popular and which products are not popular. The reason why these products are higher than other products is because the demand for education in India is currently increasing because India is a populous country with a developed education system and the government also invests and wants to encourage the use of technology in work, study and life, so the items in the electronic warehouse are always the best-selling and highest-achieving items. However, it can be seen in the chart that the second highest column is Saree. This is a traditional costume of India and because in India they prefer to wear these traditional clothes more than normal clothes, the demand for buying these traditional clothes is always high. Next are the products that are almost equally low, which are clothing products and accessories. As mentioned in India, they prefer to wear traditional clothes like Saree. So the revenue from clothing is almost zero and accessories in their country are also popularly handmade, so the demand is also low.
